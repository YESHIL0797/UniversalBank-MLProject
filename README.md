# UniversalBank-MLProject
This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model for determining the acceptance of personal loan applications at a universal bank, using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in R programming.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is a simulated version of a bank's personal loan data, including information on the applicant's credit score, income, employment history, and other relevant factors.

The model was trained using a KNN algorithm, with different number's of nearest neighbors . The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of approximately 96.56%. The most effective nearest neighbors value is 3.

The repository contains the following files:
The R script containing the implementation of the KNN algorithm
The dataset used for training and testing the model
A report describing the implementation and evaluation of the model

To use this model, you will need to have R and the necessary packages such as caret, class, and knitr installed. You can use the script provided in the repository to train the model on your own data and make predictions. It is important to note that the model is trained on a simulated dataset and may not perform as well on real-world data.

Please use this code and data at your own risk. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me or open an issue on this repository.
